# Words Dictionary Using Binary Search Tree

I wrote this program **Data Structures and Algorithms** course.

### How this code works:
The first thing you should see when executing the program is **__a prompt that asks you to enter a file name__** that contains the word and meaning each in a separate line.

### After That, if the file is successfully loaded, you can choose any choice of the following commands by typing the command's number.
##### 1. Search: Let you search for a word in the loaded dictionary.
##### 2. Edit meaning: This feature will let you edit a word's meaning (**if found**) without saving it to the data file
##### 3. Insert a new word: This feature will insert a new word to the list only if the word does not exist, else it will suggest editing the word you typed.
##### 4. List all words with meaning: let you print all your words alphabetically with their definitions.
##### 5. Delete a word: let you delete some word (**__only if it exists) without deleting it from the data file__**.
##### 6. Clear Dictionary From Memory: Let you unload your data by destroying the Binary Search Tree. Asks to save if any edit/delete/add occurred
##### 7. Update Dictionary File: Let you **update/save** your data file **only if you made an edit/delete/add**
##### 8. Load Another Dictionary File: Let you unload your data and use another data file will **only ask to save if edit/delete/add occurred**.
##### 0. Exit: **Terminate** the program only asks to save if **edit/delete/add occurs**.
